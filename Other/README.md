## Recreating a Window with Synced Devices

    How to recreate the state of a window (tabs and all) from one synced device to another.

### Steps

1. Right click window you want to save the state of and select "Bookmark all tabs..." or `Ctrl+Shift+D`.
2. Give a name to the folder to include the tabs in.
   - I personally have a folder called "Windows" where I save sub-folders of various window states, deleting as I need to in order to avoid clutter.
3. On a different synced device, open Google Chrome and right click the folder of saved tabs.
4. Right click on any innermost sub-folder and select "Open all (n)" where "n" is the number of tabs in the folder.
5. Repeat as necessary.
